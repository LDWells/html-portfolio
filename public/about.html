<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm LaDarion Wells, and I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of technology, engineering, and 
  computer science. I began my academic journey at the University of Denver as a mechanical engineering major.
   While studying engineering, I discovered a computer science course that sparked a newfound curiosity within me.
    It was during this course that I realized my true passion lay in the realm of computer science.</p>

<p>Though I have not yet obtained a formal computer science degree, my determination and drive have led me to dedicate 
  myself to continuous self-learning. Embracing a gap year due to financial considerations, I embarked on a journey of exploration and 
  skill development. It was during this time that I came across an invaluable opportunity - Per Scholas.</p>

<p>Per Scholas, an esteemed training program, has become my stepping stone towards becoming a QA Engineer. Currently, I am actively engaged
   in honing my skills and acquiring industry-relevant knowledge through their comprehensive training curriculum. This program not only equips
    me with technical expertise but also nurtures my ability to thrive in a professional IT environment.</p>
   
 <p>Upon completion of the Per Scholas training, I am eager to embark on my professional career and gain hands-on experience in an IT setting.
   This will allow me to immerse myself in the intricacies of QA Engineering and gain a deeper understanding of the field. I look forward to
    contributing my skills and collaborating with talented professionals to deliver high-quality software solutions.</p>   

 <p>While I progress in my career as a QA Engineer, I have set my sights on returning to academia to pursue a formal computer science degree. 
  This commitment stems from my desire to deepen my knowledge, explore advanced concepts, and expand my horizons within the IT industry. I believe that
   a combination of practical experience and academic rigor will empower me to make a meaningful impact in the realm of computer science.</p>

 <p>In summary, my journey from mechanical engineering to computer science, combined with my ongoing dedication to self-improvement and training,
   has shaped my determination to succeed in the field of IT. I am excited to leverage my skills, adaptability, and passion for technology to forge
    a successful and fulfilling career path.</p>
